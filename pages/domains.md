In the interest of transparency, here is a list of domains I own and control:

- 49ga.ng --- landing page for me and some friends
- diamondpigman.co.uk --- a prior alias, now redirects to this site (kept for email)
- dnomaid.co.uk --- a prior alias, now redirects to this site (kept for email)
- sleepy.social --- a Mastodon instance I help run
- thomasr.dev --- used for GitHub Pages projects
- thomasr.me --- you are here!
- thomasr.uk --- redirects to this site
- tomr.me --- redirects to this site, and for services hosted on [my homelab]({{ site.baseurl }}/lab)
- tomr.network --- used for [my homelab]({{ site.baseurl }}/lab) and internal services/hostnames
- trobinson.me --- redirects to this site
- yom.gay --- redirects to this site, and as a URL shortener

While I'm trying to move away, I have a few pages on Notion at `imtom.notion.site`.
