## Rail
On [RailMiles](https://yom.railmiles.me), I only log rail-based journeys (trains/trams/metro/etc), along with rail-replacement/supplemental buses, select people-movers, and waterbuses/ferries. I started using this service at the start of 2023.


### Visited Stations
- [Map](https://thomasr.dev/station-mapper/#gsheet)
- [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RD-5-8crKwORuKXBFUmFvfsBLY_4UsE08_duTvG-218/edit)

To be included in the list, I must have either boarded or alighted from a vehicle at the station.

**Stepping off a train and then stepping back on the same train does not count**, though waiting for the next train, or getting a train the in the opposite direction from another platform does count.
