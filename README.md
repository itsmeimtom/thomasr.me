# ThomasR.me

This is the source code for my site. 

Jekyll is the static site generator, mainly out of tradition at this point.
Vercel builds and deploys the site, since it's cooler than GitHub Pages.

Except when [noted otherwise](ATTRIBUTION.txt), content in this repo is available under the [CC-BY-SA-4.0 license](LICENCE.txt). Please do let me know if you've done something interesting with any of this terrible code/content :)
